# Assignment # 2





"Assessing another student's GIT submission."


Your goal is to write a small report outlining :

1. Did that particular submission cover all needed commands? 
 
- With the information that has been provided by Rakesh, it seems that he has used most of the commands in the right syntax. 
- He has good knowledge to change file path and configuring and initiating a new repository.
- He has used the commands correctly for creating branches.
- He has used add, commit and push commands in the right order.
- Furthermore, there were some errors which is understandable as it is a new system for all of us (students).

2. If not, what commands were missing? 

I was not able to see some commands that were given in the assignment. It may be so, that Rakesh know how to use them but unable to complete the assignment as he was not here on Monday. Anyways, following commands were missing from his assignment. 

-fetch, -Fork, -Head , -log and -stash examples


3. Do the sequences in which the commands have been written make sense? (try it out in your GIT console) 

The sequence of the commands does make sense. It seems that Rakesh knows, what he is doing most of the time.
e.g.

git add -- > git commit -- > git push --


4. What are the differences between your submission and that particular submission you are reviewing? 

It's almost similar, with respect to the command used and the result obtain. Rakesh saved some of his results in ".txt" file and it was slightly difficult to understand the result but I have consulted with Rakesh and he has also provided me with the history of commands used and explain some of his work. 
In my opinion, Rakesh has good knowledge of most of the common git commands. He knows, how and when to use it with the correct syntax. However, I don't know about the commands that were not included in his assignment. 



5. If you have found some other useful commands that were missing in the tutorial file, what were these? 

Yes, during the assignment, I was reading some of the google pages for some help and I find out about :

 git revert {commit_id}    , use to revert any commit done
 git -- help , a very good command to check about most of git functions 



6. Try out the Javascript based web tool  https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn more about branching and write down your experience of using it - - does it help you to understand?

Yes, it was  helpful to understand the commands but it will require some time to complete all the examples.
