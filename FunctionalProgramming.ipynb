    "Functional programing depends on functions and simpliying the code and instruction for users. The main difference between functional programing and other types (e.g. imperative and object oriented programing) is that the functions that are evaluated are the main way of transforming data.The lack of state allows a functional language is to be reasoned just by looking at a functional's input and output.Generally, instead of loops, recursions are used. The functional coding style treats everything like a math equation. The function package provides access to higher-order functions for data manipulation.However, you don't always user it to perform functional programming wtih python. e.g.import functoolsmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]sum = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, my_list)print(sum)"
